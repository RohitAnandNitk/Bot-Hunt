The AI Impersonator
A game of deception and wit, where players must identify which of the "players" in a room is actually an AI.

How it works: A group of players joins a room, but one of the "players" is an AI (like a highly-tuned GPT model). The AI is given a personaâ€”a specific background, hobbies, and a unique personality.

The twist: All players, human and AI, engage in a conversation or a series of mini-games (e.g., "Would you rather...?", "Tell a funny story about yourself"). The human players' goal is to figure out which one is the AI. The AI's goal is to go undetected. Players can ask questions, analyze responses, and vote on who they believe is the imposter. The AI wins if it avoids being voted out.

Why it's fun: It's a modern take on social deduction games like Among Us or Mafia. The AI's ability to generate human-like conversation makes it incredibly difficult to spot, and its responses can be surprisingly convincing. It's a fun and sometimes unnerving exploration of the uncanny valley.
